# rock-paper-scissors
Basic game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer
## What is this?
This is a program I wrote for a quick bit of fun. There is a simple weighting system that the computer uses to figure out its next move.
## Inspiration
In considering this as the next program for my portfolio, I came up with the mechanics of how I would do it on a piece of scratch paper. Since I'd already basically written it, I figured I'd just do it for real. I also included the weights stuff because I'm interested in machine learning, and while this definitely isn't that, I figured it might be fun to do something a little more interactive than simple random guesses.
## Prerequisites
Python3
## Using Rock Paper Scissors
First you enter your name, and let the computer know whether you're ready to play. Then you just type rock, paper, scissors, or exit. That's literally the whole thing.
## How it was built
This program was written in VS Code
## What I learned
I learned a little bit about weights for this program.
## What's next
I think it might be fun to adjust the calculations used to determine weight so that it looks for patterns in user throwing strategy, and explore more about Machine Learning in general
